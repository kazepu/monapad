  Monapad
</h1>
<p align="center">
  A modern and minimalist text editor that uses the same Monaco Editor as VSCode, offering a dark theme, tab support, and lightweight highlight features.
</p>

## Features

Monapad is a modern text editor designed for simplicity and speed, built on the Monaco Editor ‚Äî the same core editor used in Visual Studio Code. Its key features include:

- A clean, modern dark theme-only interface for distraction-free writing.
- Smooth and responsive tab management, similar to the Chromium browser experience.
- Supports many of the same keyboard shortcuts and functionalities as VSCode.
- Special line formatting:
  - Lines starting with `# ` are highlighted.
  - Lines starting with `-# ` are shown in gray.
- Built-in syntax highlighting for Markdown.

Standard text editors can become hard to read when handling large documents, as all text often appears in the same color. Monapad was created to solve this by offering lightweight highlight features without fully relying on Markdown formatting. It also allows users to use familiar VSCode-style shortcuts and editing features.

The name "Monapad" combines Monaco (the editor engine) and Notepad, reflecting its purpose: a simple yet powerful editing experience. With support for text search and replace, multi-cursor editing, and essential editing operations, Monapad brings the familiarity of VSCode into a streamlined package.

TL;DR: You might notice that I work for Microsoft but Notepads is my personal project that I accomplish during free time (to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve moreüòÉ). I do not work for the Windows team, nor do I work for a Microsoft UX/App team. I am not expert on creating Windows apps either. I learned how to code UWP as soon as I started this project, so don‚Äôt put too much hope on me or treat it as a project sponsored by Microsoft.
